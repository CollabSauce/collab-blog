User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a type of testing performed by the end user or the client to verify/accept the software system before moving the software application is moved into the production environment. UAT is done in the final phase of testing after functional, integration and system testing is done.

The aim of UAT is actually to validate end to end business flow. It’s important to keep in mind that it does not focus on systems testing, cosmetic errors or spelling mistakes. In addition, UAT should be executed against test scenarios. Test scenarios usually differ from System or Functional test cases in that they represent a "player" or "user" journey. The broad nature of the test scenario ensures that the focus is on the journey and not on technical or system-specific details, staying away from "click-by-click" test steps to allow for a variance in users' behavior. Test scenarios can be broken down into logical "days", which are usually where the actor (player/customer/operator) or system (backoffice, front end) changes.

Lastly, if UAT verifies that everything is properly working, an orderly sign-off needs to be completed. This can be carried out with your client or the team they have assembled for the project, where they state that what they’ve received works as expected and meets their criteria.

**Who does UAT?**

Typically an internal business representative such as a sales representative, business development representative, CEO, or other role not involved in the product development process has a request for a new feature.

**Why UAT?**

The individual stakeholder requesting a feature set should also be the one to test the feature they requested to make sure it meets the specifications they originally desired (or the feature their client desired).

**How does Collab Sauce help UAT?** 

Typically UAT results and requests are reported in tools that engineers and product managers are familar with like JIRA or Trello, which many stakeholders are unfamiliar with. Collab Sauce empowers stakeholders to create requests right on websites. Furthermore, Collab Sauce's no-code visual design editors makes changes directly on the website that can be implemented exactly by developers or designer with the automated CSS code generated. When stakeholders are testing features requested, they can seamlessly provide feedback while testing without reporting on 3rd party websites and tools such as email or JIRA. This reduces time stakeholders spend reporting new features, giving feedback, and reduces the miscommunications and implementation for devlopers in this new remote first world.
